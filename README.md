# COVID-19 Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person being infected with COVID-19 based on various symptoms and risk factors, using several machine learning algorithms.

## Introduction

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of lives worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial in controlling the spread of the virus. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict COVID-19 infection based on symptoms and other relevant factors.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about individuals, including symptoms experienced and potential risk factors for COVID-19. It includes the following columns:

- Breathing Problem
- Fever
- Dry Cough
- Sore throat
- Running Nose
- Asthma
- Chronic Lung Disease
- Headache
- Heart Disease
- Diabetes
- Hyper Tension
- Fatigue
- Gastrointestinal
- Abroad travel
- Contact with COVID Patient
- Attended Large Gathering
- Visited Public Exposed Places
- Family working in Public Exposed Places

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Classifier

## Results

The project evaluates the performance of different machine learning algorithms in predicting COVID-19 infection. Here are some key findings:

- Logistic Regression achieved an accuracy of X%.
- K-Nearest Neighbors achieved an accuracy of X% with the best parameter of Y neighbors.
- Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of X% with the following parameters: ...

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/covid19-prediction.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the main script to perform COVID-19 prediction:

```bash
python predict_covid.py
```

## Conclusion

Machine learning models can be valuable tools in predicting COVID-19 infection based on symptoms and risk factors. However, further validation and testing are necessary before deploying such models in real-world scenarios.
